1,Land-use dynamics influence estimates of carbon sequestration potential in tropical second-growth forest,Peruvian Amazon,"Many countries have made major commitments to carbon sequestration through reforestation under the Paris Climate Agreement, and recent studies have illustrated the potential for large amounts of carbon sequestration in tropical second-growth forests. However, carbon gains in second-growth forests are threatened by non-permanence, i.e. release of carbon into the atmosphere from clearing or disturbance. The benefits of second-growth forests require long-term persistence on the landscape, but estimates of carbon potential rarely consider the spatio-temporal landscape dynamics of second-growth forests. In this study, we used remotely sensed imagery from a landscape in the Peruvian Amazon to examine patterns of second-growth forest regrowth and permanence over 28 years (1985–2013).","Naomi B Schwartz, María Uriarte, Ruth DeFries, Victor H Gutierrez-Velez and Miguel A Pinedo-Vasquez",-8.371027,-74.484561,
2,Drought effects in heterogeneous landscapes,El Yunque National Forest,"Future increases in drought frequency and intensity will likely have major impacts on tropical forests, but predicting drought impacts remains difficult in part because the drivers of spatial variability in drought effects are not well understood. The severity of water stress a tree experiences during drought depends on where it is located in a landscape due to spatial heterogeneity in topography, soil factors, or the competitive environment. Furthermore, vulnerability to drought differs across species and size classes, which may in turn be associated with various landscape factors. I am using remote sensing, tree demography, and functional trait data to try to better understand the drivers of spatial heterogeneity in drought response in Puerto Rican forests at scales ranging from individual trees to forest stands. ",Naomi B.

3,Fragmentation increases wind disturbance impacts on forest structure and carbon stocks in a western Amazonian landscape. ,"Ucayali, Peru","Tropical second‐growth forests could help mitigate climate change, but the degree to which their carbon potential is achieved will depend on exposure to disturbance. Wind disturbance is common in tropical forests, shaping structure, composition, and function, and influencing successional trajectories. However, little is known about the impacts of extreme winds on second‐growth forests in fragmented landscapes, though these ecosystems are often located in mosaics of forest, pasture, cropland, and other land cover types. Indirect evidence suggests that fragmentation increases risk of wind damage in tropical forests, but no studies have found such impacts following severe storms. In this study, we ask whether fragmentation and forest type (old vs. second growth) were associated with variation in wind damage after a severe convective storm in a fragmented production landscape in western Amazonia. ","Naomi B.

4,"Climate, landowner residency, and land cover predict local scale fire activity in the Western Amazon","Pucallpa and Campo Verde, Peru","The incidence of escaped agricultural fire has recently been increasing in the Western Amazon, driven by climate variability, land use change, and changes in patterns of residency and land occupation. Preventing and mitigating the negative impacts of fire in the Amazon require a comprehensive understanding not only of what the drivers of fire activity are, but also how these drivers interact and vary across scales. Here, we combine multi-scalar data on land use, climate, and landowner residency to disentangle the drivers of fire activity over 10 years (2001–2010) on individual landholdings in a fireprone region of the Peruvian Amazon.","Naomi B.
